# Code of Conduct

This project follows the Contributor Covenant to foster an open and welcoming community.

## Our Pledge
We pledge to make participation in this project a harassment‑free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio‑economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing respect for time, attention, and resources (be concise and clear)

Unacceptable behavior includes:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information (doxing) without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards; they may remove, edit, or reject contributions not aligned with this Code and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope
This Code applies within all project spaces and when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement
Report unacceptable behavior to the maintainers:
- Preferred: email <REPLACE_WITH_CONTACT_EMAIL>
- Or open an issue labeled `coc` (omit sensitive details; maintainers will follow up privately)

All complaints will be reviewed promptly and fairly. The maintainers will respect the reporter’s privacy and handle reports confidentially to the extent possible.

## Enforcement Guidelines
When addressing violations, maintainers will consider the impact of the behavior and apply these guidelines:

1. Correction
- Impact: Use of inappropriate language or minor violation.
- Consequence: Private, written warning with clarity around expected behavior.

2. Warning
- Impact: A single incident or series of actions with moderate impact.
- Consequence: Official warning; continued violations may result in temporary restrictions.

3. Temporary Ban
- Impact: A serious violation or repeated behavior after warnings.
- Consequence: Temporary restriction from interaction or contribution for a specified period.

4. Permanent Ban
- Impact: Demonstrating a pattern of violation or harassment; threats of violence; doxing.
- Consequence: Permanent removal from project spaces and contribution privileges.
