# Security Policy

This document outlines the security practices and policies for the homelab Docker infrastructure.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in this homelab setup, please report it through one of these methods:

- **Preferred**: Open a GitHub issue with the `security` label
- **Email**: Contact the repository maintainer directly for sensitive issues

Please include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Affected services or components
- Potential impact assessment

## Security Architecture

### Network Isolation
- All services use the external `homelab` Docker network for controlled communication
- Services are not exposed directly to the internet unless explicitly configured
- Nginx Proxy Manager acts as the primary ingress point with SSL/TLS termination

### Access Control
- Services requiring authentication use their built-in authentication systems
- No default passwords are used (all credentials are environment-specific)
- Administrative interfaces are protected and not exposed publicly

### Data Protection
- Persistent data is stored in service-specific Docker volumes or bind mounts
- Configuration directories (`config/`) are excluded from version control
- Environment files (`.env`) containing secrets are gitignored

## Security Best Practices

### Environment Configuration
- **Never commit `.env` files** - they contain sensitive credentials
- Use strong, unique passwords for all service accounts
- Regularly rotate credentials, especially for administrative accounts
- Set appropriate `PUID` and `PGID` values to prevent privilege escalation

### Container Security
- Keep Docker images updated using Watchtower or manual updates
- Use official or well-maintained community images
- Limit container capabilities where possible
- Run containers with non-root users when supported

### Network Security
- Use the `homelab` network to isolate services from other Docker networks
- Only expose necessary ports to the host system
- Configure firewall rules to restrict external access
- Use HTTPS/SSL for all web interfaces via Nginx Proxy Manager

### Monitoring & Logging
- Monitor container logs for suspicious activity
- Use Homarr and Dash for service health monitoring
- Implement log rotation to prevent disk space issues
- Review access logs regularly for unauthorized access attempts

## Service-Specific Security

### Core Infrastructure
- **Pi-hole**: Configure DNS filtering lists, use strong admin password
- **Nginx Proxy Manager**: Use SSL certificates, restrict admin access
- **Watchtower**: Configure update schedules carefully, monitor update logs

### Media Management
- **Jellyfin/Radarr/Sonarr**: Use API keys, limit network access
- **qBittorrent**: Use VPN if required, configure download restrictions

### Monitoring & Management
- **pgAdmin**: Use strong master password, limit database connections
- **Unifi Network Application**: Follow Ubiquiti security recommendations

### Home Automation
- **Home Assistant**: Enable advanced authentication, use HTTPS, regular backups

## Backup & Recovery

### Data Backup
- Regularly backup Docker volumes and configuration files
- Test backup restoration procedures
- Store backups securely and separately from the main system

### Disaster Recovery
- Document service dependencies and startup order
- Maintain updated configuration documentation
- Keep copies of environment templates and important configurations

## Compliance & Updates

### Security Updates
- Monitor security advisories for used Docker images
- Apply security updates promptly
- Subscribe to security mailing lists for major services

### Regular Audits
- Periodically review service configurations
- Audit user accounts and access permissions
- Review network configurations and exposed services
- Validate backup and recovery procedures

## Incident Response

### Detection
- Monitor service logs for anomalies
- Watch for unusual network traffic or resource usage
- Set up alerts for service failures or security events

### Response Procedures
1. **Isolate** affected services by stopping containers
2. **Assess** the scope and impact of the incident
3. **Document** all findings and actions taken
4. **Remediate** by applying fixes, patches, or configuration changes
5. **Monitor** for additional issues or reoccurrence

### Recovery
- Restore services from known-good backups if necessary
- Update security measures to prevent similar incidents
- Update documentation based on lessons learned

## Security Checklist

### Initial Setup
- [ ] Create external `homelab` Docker network
- [ ] Configure strong passwords in all `.env` files
- [ ] Set appropriate file permissions on configuration directories
- [ ] Enable SSL/HTTPS for all web interfaces
- [ ] Configure firewall rules

### Regular Maintenance
- [ ] Review and update Docker images monthly
- [ ] Audit service logs weekly
- [ ] Check for security updates and advisories
- [ ] Verify backup integrity
- [ ] Review user accounts and permissions

### Before Adding New Services
- [ ] Review service security documentation
- [ ] Configure authentication and authorization
- [ ] Set up proper network isolation
- [ ] Document service-specific security considerations
- [ ] Test security configurations
